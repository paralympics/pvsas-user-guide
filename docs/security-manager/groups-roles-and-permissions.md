# Groups, Roles and Permissions

As explained in the previous sections, user groups function as an intermediary link between 
users, roles and permissions. The name and code of the group are connected to the lists of 
users in the group and the roles and permissions enabled by the group membership.

The search form lists all currently existing groups with links to each group’s list of users, 
roles and permissions. As assigning groups are important for creating an account with correct 
permissions, this section will outline the currently existing groups and list the permissions 
enabled by the account. All groups enable the password role, as this is obligatory for every 
account to function.

## Full access and limited access roles

Broadly, the roles can be divided into two main groups – those that give full access to adding,
modifying and removing data, and those that only give access to reports and reading of data. 
The list of full access roles is virtually identical to those assigned to the administrator 
group labelled **“NPC”**; all other roles are limited in operations.

## Permission types

PVSAS only applies a single permission type.

- **National Federation:** Determines which countries the user has access to. All codes for 
  the NPC members are possible selections. When a new federation is added, it must be 
  registered as potential data permission under *User Management > Permissions*.

A user can have multiple permissions of one type, or the % permission which means the user
has no restrictions that data permission.
