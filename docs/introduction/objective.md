This document describes all important functionalities of PVSAS, a web-based application 
designed to securely capture, store and retrieve athletesâ€™ personal and classification data 
managed by the national member federation (NFs) supervised by the World ParaVolley 
federation. This manual is targeted to staff members of World ParaVolley, its member 
federations and their classifiers and aims to assist the users in the following areas of the system: 
- Application Settings 
- Participant Management (e.g., athlete registration, biography capture, sport class 
assignment) 
- Classification Management (e.g., confirmation of classes, classification file upload and 
review, medical documents)

This manual covers all sections of the application even if different user groups have different or 
limited access to the sections. This is outlined in each section of this user guide.
