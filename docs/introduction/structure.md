# Structure

The current chapter describes the general objective of this manual and briefly summarizes the history of PVSAS development. 

[SDMS Website, Layout and Functionalities](layout-and-functionalities/access.md) explains how to get an account for PVSAS, how to access this database, the navigation through the application, the menu bars, and general usages of search forms, and buttons appearing on several pages. Please read this chapter if you are not experienced with high security applications in general or with PVSAS in specific.

The following chapters begin with the initialization of PVSAS ([Application Settings](application-settings/configuration.md)), each module of PVSAS is considered. The menu sub-structure is reflected by the respective chapter structure for easy navigation and reference.

An exact step-for-step instruction for registration of athletes (including topics such as [Personal Data / Registration](athletes/personal-data-or-registration.md) and [Nationality Validation](athletes/nationality-validation.md)) and their [Classification](athletes/classification.md) including file management; supports the user to fulfil the requirements and follow the processes efficiently.

[Calendar](calendar/competitions.md) concerns the registration of upcoming events and/or classification panels, their classifiers and attending athletes.

The application produces a set of customisable reports for overview of the stored data. These files are described in [Reports](reports/classification-files.md). Finally, [Security Manager](security-manager/user-accounts.md) contains information about the user management and security structure built into PVSAS.
