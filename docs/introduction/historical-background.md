# History and Development of PVSAS

Since 2009, the IPC Sport Data Management System (IPC SDMS) has been running successfully and has become the central tool of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and its IPC sports for athleteâ€™s data, classification, competition calendar, achieved results, confirmed records, and calculation mechanism of rankings and qualification lists for major events.

In January 2015, the IPC launched a second version derived from the IPC SDMS that since supports the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) in their daily operation regarding athletes registration and classification across their sports. That application applies a separate look and feel as well as IBSA specific business processes with focus on athlete registration, classification, licensing and competition entries. Additionally, it shares some basic tables like athletes with IPC SDMS to improve the client experience and overall data quality in the Paralympic Movement.

With the increased awareness of the existence of the international SDMS versions in place for the IPC and IBSA, consultations between the World ParaVolley federation and the IPC took place to outline options and possibilities to make use of such a version for the ParaVolley operations. Finally, it was agreed to realise this project, and PVSAS was developed and launched in March 2018.
