# Nationality Validation

*This section is only necessary to consider for athletes who are going to compete at international competitions, in any IPC sport, IPC sanctioned or even the Paralympic Games, in relation to the IPC Athlete Nationality Policy.*

The Nationality Validation screen offers a more concentrated view of data relevant to an
athlete’s ID and nationality, as well as any changes that may have been approved by the World
ParaVolley federation. The search screen offers filters by athlete ID, name, document number
and nationality, as well as nationality status, which means that, for example, the member
federation can quickly find all cases which have to be reviewed under the regulations of World
ParaVolley.

In addition to the search by nationality status, you can also search for all athletes that may
potentially have nationality issues, which returns athletes where the member federation users
have registered they have competed for another country before. In such cases, a release
document from the previous NPC or member federation may be required.

The details screen, available from clicking on an athlete, has a section *Nationality Information*
which duplicates what is also available from the *Personal Details* screen, as well as a 
*Nationality Data History* section which details all changes made to nationality documentation, 
with a timestamp, and a copy of a scanned document if uploaded. Any change in passport information
is registered here. Likewise, replaced nationality documents, e.g. passport copies, are still
available from this page, while only the most current version is accessible from the athlete’s
detail page.

Registration administrators are also allowed to change the nationality status from this screen, as
they cannot do this directly from the *Personal Details*.
