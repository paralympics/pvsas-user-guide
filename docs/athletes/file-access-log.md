# File Access Log

Each time when any user of PVSAS opens or downloads a classification document from the
classification detail page of an athlete (see [Documentation](athletes/classification.md#documentation)) or generates a package with classification
files for a major selection of athletes (see [Classification Files](reports/classification-files.md)), the access to these files are logged here.

The access log finally contains the information about which user identified by the username
opened/downloaded which file (file ID and file category) for which athlete (ID, family and given
name) at which exact time. This information is required to fulfil national obligations to prove and
monitor the accesses to these files, especially in case of sensitive information like the medical
documentation.
