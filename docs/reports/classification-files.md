IDâ€™s in each archive are listed on the download page for reference. Each archive should be
downloaded separately by clicking the <img src="_img/inline/icon-file-package.svg" alt="File Package" class="inline">icon.

Each ZIP packages contains one folder by athlete ID, and each folder all current (and historical
