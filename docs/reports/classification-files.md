# Classification Files

In this section, you may download one or more ZIP archives of all uploaded classification forms 
of athletes in PVSAS. Each ZIP archive will be at maximum 25 MB in size; if larger downloads are 
required, they will be split automatically and must be downloaded separately.

| **Field**      | **Format**             | **Comments**        |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Discipline** | drop-down [value list] | Sitting or Standing |

When you click **Prepare Packages**, a new page is opened with a list of archive(s) that have been
prepared. The packages and files inside are sorted by Athlete ID, and the smallest and largest
IDâ€™s in each archive are listed on the download page for reference. Each archive should be
downloaded separately by clicking the <img src="_img/inline/icon-file-package.svg" alt="File Package" class="inline">icon.

Each ZIP packages contains one folder by athlete ID, and each folder all current (and historical
files if requested) labelled by the additional field code of the related file container.
